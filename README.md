# WP1.5_histology_viewer

### NCITA Repository Unit Work Package 1.5: XNAT-OHIF viewer - Histology viewer
Specific repositories and projects of the form WP1.x-y are for specific second-level, viewer-related work packages in the NCITA Repository Unit strategy.

The aim of WP1.5 (yet to start) will be to incorporate into the XNAT viewer, the ability to view and annotate whole-slide histology in XNAT, saving the results in the relevant DICOM format, currently under discussion by DICOM WG-26.

The NCITA Repository Unit site as a whole is at an early stage of the life cycle and does not currently have a formal structure of documentation releases. Please bear with us: things will become more organised as the NCITA project gets into gear! Note that the ICR also releases code related to the XNAT-OHIF image viewer at https://bitbucket.org/icrimaginginformatics/.
